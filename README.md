# Ripple
App that allows users to take and create uplifting challenges with the ultimate goal of creating a positive societal ripple effect

---- 
## Introduction 
There are a lot of mindfulness resources out there but few of them give you actionable, take-home exercises (called challenges in the App) to deepen your practice. Almost none of them give you a means to share your experiences with other users or review the effectiveness of an exercise. 

I built this app in about three weeks to fill some of these gaps and, though I didn't hit all of my lofty goals, I did create a pretty cool project skeleton and learned React Native along the way!  

## Technologies 

#### Front-end
* React Native via Expo 4.3.1
* Styled-Components
[Take a look at my frontend repo for more information](https://github.com/Ekenayy/Ripple-frontend)

#### Back-end

* Active Record
* Postgres

2. In your frontend terminal run 'npm start'.

3. For Iphone, if you have XCode installed simply choose to run the app on your ios simulator. For Android, choose to run on an AVD of your choice. If you do not have XCode or Android Studio you'll need to install one of your choice.
